## Prerequisites

In order to run this project, a few technologies are required:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org)

If you have these installed already, you can skip to [running this project](#running-this-project).

Node.js is what allows us to write all our applications in JavaScript. Usually, JavaScript is run only in a web browser. By building on top of Node.js, we can write code that is executed on the server, simpler to write, and/or more secure.

### Installing Node

#### Node for Windows

On windows, you can install node from the [Node.js downloads page](https://nodejs.org/en/download). Make sure you install the LTS (long-term support) version! Download and run the installer.

:warning: If shown a check box to install "tools for native modules" make sure you check the box before clicking next :warning:

Once the installation is finished (and you have restarted you computer if prompted), you can continue to [installing Docker](#installing-docker).

#### Node for Mac/Linux

It is recommended to use [node version manager (nvm)](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) to install and run node on Mac/Linux. You can install is by using the command found [here](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installing-and-updating) in your terminal application. Alternatively, you can follow the installation instructions in the [windows instructions](#node-for-windows).

Once you have installed node version manager installed, run the following commands in your terminal:

```bash
nvm install --lts # Install latest version of Node.js
nvm install-latest-npm # Update npm to latest version
```

These commands do the following:

1. Install the long-term support (LTS) version of Node. The LTS version is the version of Node that will receive security updates the longest.
2. Update the node package manager (npm) to the latest version.

This completes your installation of Node!

### Installing pnpm (recommended/optional)

pnpm is an improved version of the Node Package Manager (npm). Though not required, it is highly recommended that you install it. You can install it using the following command in your terminal/powershell after node has been installed

```bash
npm install -g pnpm
```

If you choose to install pnpm, then you can substitute all usage of 'npm' with 'pnpm' and all usage of 'npx' with 'pnpx'. Additionally, you can create an alias in your `.bashrc` (Linux) or `.zshrc` (Mac) files. This will mean that when you type in npm or npx, pnpm and pnpx will be substituted. Use the following commands to add the aliases to the corresponding file:

```bash
# Linux
echo 'alias npm="pnpm"' >> .bashrc

# Mac
echo 'alias npm="pnpm"' >> .zshrc
```

## Running This Project

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
